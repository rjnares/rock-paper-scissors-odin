# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a basic rock, paper, scissors game created as a project assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Description

This game is played via a simple three-button UI menu with options for the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors. The game is played round-by-round until the player or the cpu reaches a score of 5 points. Each round consists of the following actions:
* The player will click a button for the move they would like to make
* The cpu will generate a random choice of rock, paper, or scissors
* The player and cpu choices will be compared and the winner of the round will get a point (unless it's a tie, in which case, no one gets a point)
* The winner is declared when the player or cpu reaches a score of 5 points


## Skills Applied

The initial goal of this project was to create a simple, interactive JavaScript application in order to apply what was taught in the [JavaScript Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) section of the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.

# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a basic rock, paper, scissors game created as a project assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Description

This game is played completely via the browser console by calling the "playGame()" function. The game consists of five rounds, where each round consists of the following actions:
* The cpu will generate a random choice of rock, paper, or scissors
* The player will be prompted to enter a choice of rock, paper, or scissors as input
* The cpu and player choices will be compared and the winner of the round will get a point (unless it's a tie, in which case, no one gets a point)
* The winner is declared at the end of the five rounds (unless it's a tie, in which case, the game ends in a draw)


## Skills Applied

The main goal of this project was to create a simple, interactive JavaScript application in order to apply what was taught in the [JavaScript Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) section of the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.
